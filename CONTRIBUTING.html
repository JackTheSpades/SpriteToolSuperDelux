    <h1 id="contributing">CONTRIBUTING</h1>
    <h2 id="general-rules-">General rules:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Decently descriptive commit messages (with descriptions if necessary).
      </li>
      <li>
        The GitHub actions runner on Ubuntu does a quite expensive test on each
        run. This can be skipped by adding <code>[NoTest]</code> add the
        beginning of the title of the commit message. This is recommended to add
        when your changes only affect the CFG Editor, since the expensive test
        only affects Pixi.
      </li>
      <li>Use spaces for everything, no tabs. 4 spaces per tab.</li>
      <li>Avoid breaking changes unless they give a huge benefit.</li>
      <li>
        Don&#39;t be rude and don&#39;t insult/disrespect other people&#39;s
        code.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since this is a multi-part project I&#39;ll illustrate rules based on
      language.
    </p>
    <h2 id="asm-">ASM:</h2>
    <p>For asm files, the following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>!snake_case for defines</li>
      <li>%PascalCase() for macros/functions</li>
      <li>camelCase for labels</li>
      <li>Have label names be descriptive</li>
      <li>
        Avoid abbreviations if you can unless they&#39;re very widely used, keep
        names of everything under 30 characters
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to always separate sub-routines into macros when possible if you
        want to avoid the cost of JSR-RTS but still reap the benefits of the
        readability of separation
      </li>
      <li>
        Use +/- labels sparingly, use them only when skipping a single
        instruction, 2 at most, and only a single level, seeing ++++ only makes
        code hard to read
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid loading magic constants (e.g. LDA #$45), give them a define name
        that states clearly what they are
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep things containerized, don&#39;t let macro bleed out labels in the
        top level, use macro labels
      </li>
      <li>
        Indent code by 4 spaces even at top level, code all the way at the left
        of the page is weird, labels can be at the very left
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid comments unless absolutely necessary, especially in the middle of
        code
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="c-">C++:</h2>
    <p>For C++ files, the following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use modern C++ code style. Prefer newer C++17/C++20 idioms over old
        C-style code
      </li>
      <li>Don&#39;t abuse templates too much</li>
      <li>Don&#39;t <code>using namespace std;</code></li>
      <li>
        Don&#39;t use external libraries unless you have to (e.g. writing an
        entire json parser)
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid abusing the preprocessor to hell and back (macro galore is a
        no-no)
      </li>
      <li>
        If you can use the <code>std::</code> for something, use it, don&#39;t
        reinvent the wheel
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="c-">C#:</h2>
    <p>For C# files, the following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don&#39;t misuse LINQ</li>
      <li>Keep the same style as existing code</li>
      <li>
        Keep the code as simple as you can and touch it as little as possible
      </li>
    </ul>
