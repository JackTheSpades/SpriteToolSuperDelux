; Poison mushroom patch
; original binary by mikey, asm version plus slight modification by JackTheSpades
;
; This patch will overwrite an existing sprite and turn it into the poison mushroom instead.
; Note that you shouldn't reapply this patch to the same ROM after changing !NUM as it will
; NOT remove the previous insertion.

; You can however freely change the other defines and reapply then
