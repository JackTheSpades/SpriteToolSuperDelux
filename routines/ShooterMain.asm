;THIS ROUTINE SHOULD ONLY BE CALLED BY A SHOOTER!!!
;Routine to check if a shooter should fire or not.
;Checks if the shooter is offscreen and if the timer has run out and sets it if so.

;
;Output: Y   = index for sprite create (#$FF means no sprite spawned)
;        C   = Carry Set = don't shoot (return), Carry Clear = shoot (generate sprite)
