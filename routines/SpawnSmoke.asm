;Routine that spawns a smoke sprite with a position (+offset) and timer and returns
;the sprite index in Y

;Input:  A   = number of sprite to spawn
;        $00 = x offset  \
;        $01 = y offset  | you could also just ignore these and set them later
;        $02 = timer     /
;
;Output: Y   = index to spawned sprite (#$FF means no sprite spawned)
;        C   = Carry Set = spawn failed, Carry Clear = spawn successful.
;
;Number cheatsheet:
;		#$01 = Puff of smoke.
