;Output: Y   = 0 => Mario to the right of the sprite,
;              1 => Mario being on the left.
;        $0E = 16 bit difference beween Mario X Pos - Sprite X Pos.

;CAUTION!!!
;        Some sprites use a version of this routine where only $0F is being stored to
;        as the low byte of the distance (here it is the high byte)
